## Setup Instructions

### 1. Obtain Your Paprika App API Token
To use this integration, you need your Paprika App API token. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following `curl` command, replacing `MY_EMAIL` with your Paprika account email and `MY_PAPRIKA_PASSWORD` with your password:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://paprikaapp.com/api/v2/account/login -d 'email=MY_EMAIL&password=MY_PAPRIKA_PASSWORD'
   ```

3. The response will contain a field called `token`. Copy this token; you'll need it during setup.

### 2. Add the Integration
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Integrations**.
2. Click the **Add Integration** button.
3. Search for "Turmeric" and select it.
4. Enter your Paprika API token.
5. Configure the refresh intervals (in minutes) for groceries and meals (default: 360 and 720 respectively).
6. Save the configuration.

### 3. Verify Sensors
1. Navigate to **Developer Tools** → **States**.
2. Look for `sensor.turmeric_groceries` and `sensor.turmeric_meals`.
3. Verify that the data is populated correctly.

#### YAML Configuration
```yaml
type: markdown
title: Grocery List
content: |
  {% if state_attr('sensor.turmeric_groceries', 'aisles') %}
  **Grocery List:**
  {% for aisle, items in state_attr('sensor.turmeric_groceries', 'aisles').items() %}
  **{{ aisle }}**
  {% for item in items %}
  - {{ item }}
  {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
  {% else %}
  No grocery items available.
  {% endif %}
```

### Upcoming Meals Card
Displays a numbered list of the next seven planned meals.

#### YAML Configuration
```yaml
type: markdown
title: Upcoming Meals
content: |
  {% if state_attr('sensor.turmeric_meals', 'meals') %}
  {% for meal in state_attr('sensor.turmeric_meals', 'meals') %}
  {{ loop.index }}. {{ meal.name }} - {{ meal.date }}
  {% endfor %}
  {% else %}
  No upcoming meals planned.
  {% endif %}
```

## Configuration Options

During setup, you can configure the following options:
- **API Token**: Your Paprika App API token.
- **Groceries Refresh Rate**: Frequency (in minutes) to refresh grocery data (default: 360).
- **Meals Refresh Rate**: Frequency (in minutes) to refresh meal data (default: 720).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Integration Not Visible**:
   - Ensure files are in `/config/custom_components/turmeric/`.
   - Restart Home Assistant and clear the browser cache.

2. **Sensors Returning `Unknown`**:
   - Verify the API token is correct.
   - Check logs under **Settings** → **System** → **Logs** for errors.

3. **Markdown Card Formatting Issues**:
   - Verify the card YAML is correctly indented.
   - Ensure the sensors are populated with data.

### Debugging Logs
Enable debug logging for the integration by adding the following to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.turmeric: debug
```

Check the logs under **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time push updates from Paprika App? (May not be possible)
- Optional step to use Paprika Login info to automatically pull users token.
- Options to toggle upcoming meals display by count or by date.
- Support for more Paprika API endpoints.
- Enhanced error handling and validation.

Thanks to the following inspirations: 

Darius K ( https://community.home-assistant.io/u/dariusk/ ) - RESTful sensor pull that I first found. My frustration at trying to find a nice way to format the output in this pushed me over to figuring out how to do it in an integration way to make things easier.

@mattdsteele ( https://gist.github.com/mattdsteele/7386ec363badfdeaad05a418b9a1f30a ) which helped me figure out the groceries API link and some other things.
