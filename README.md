## Setup Instructions

### 1. Obtain Your Paprika App API Token
To use this integration, you need your Paprika App API token. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following `curl` command, replacing `MY_EMAIL` with your Paprika account email and `MY_PAPRIKA_PASSWORD` with your password:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://paprikaapp.com/api/v1/account/login -d 'email=MY_EMAIL&password=MY_PAPRIKA_PASSWORD'
   ```

3. The response will contain a field called `token`. Copy this token; you'll need it during setup.

### 2. Add the Integration
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Integrations**.
2. Click the **Add Integration** button.
3. Search for "Turmeric" and select it.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Integration Not Visible**:
   - Ensure files are in `/config/custom_components/turmeric/`.
   - Restart Home Assistant and clear the browser cache.

2. **Sensors Returning `Unknown`**:
   - Verify the API token is correct.
   - Check logs under **Settings** → **System** → **Logs** for errors.

3. **Markdown Card Formatting Issues**:
   - Verify the card YAML is correctly indented.
   - Ensure the sensors are populated with data.

### Debugging Logs
Enable debug logging for the integration by adding the following to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.turmeric: debug
```

Check the logs under **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**.

Thanks to the following inspirations: 

Darius K ( https://community.home-assistant.io/u/dariusk/ ) - RESTful sensor pull that I first found. My frustration at trying to find a nice way to format the output in this pushed me over to figuring out how to do it in an integration way to make things easier.

@mattdsteele ( https://gist.github.com/mattdsteele/7386ec363badfdeaad05a418b9a1f30a ) which helped me figure out the groceries API link and some other things.
